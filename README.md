1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Strategy to use to get the job done
Here is where I would put into practice the software development lifecycle into action.
My strategy involves the following steps:
- Project Planning
- Technology Stack Selection
- Architecture and Design
- System Development based on the ideas from the steps above
- Performance Optimization
- Internationalization using i18n: translating the entire app into different languages
- Testing and Quality Assurance
- Documentation
- Deployment
- Monitoring and Maintenance

## Deployed version of the app

Click the following to see the app in action: https://hotels-and-co.vercel.app/

## NB
Because the API server from which I fetched the data for this app is deployed on a free tier when you run the application for the first time, it will take some time for the API server to respond back with the data, Please just wait for 1 up to 5 minutes and after that, the API server will work as normal.
